# Two-channel-Filterbank
Reconstruction of a signal using two channel filterbank

1) Reconstruction of a sine wave using two channel filter
  Low pass and high pass filter coefficients are initialized
 
2) Using Legall filter coefficients to reconstruct a sine wave after upsampling and downsampling operation
